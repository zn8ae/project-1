Tests:
1. Telnet in terminal
	   1) Test goal: test the server can return proper response
	   2) Test procedures:
	      1. connect server 
	         telnet 127.0.0.1 8080 
	      2. send requests
	         GET / HTTP/1.1    # return 200 OK and index.html
		 HEAD / HTTP/1.1   # return 200 OK proper header info
	         GET / HTTP/1.0    # return 505 HTTP Version Not Supported
	         GET /foo HTTP/1.1 # return 404 Not Found
                 POST / HTTP/1.1   # return 411 Length Required 
		 etcâ€¦

	
2. SMOKE test
	   1) Test goal: server compiles with no error and can return message from the
	      client upon first run
	   2) Test procedures:
	      a) compile programs by make
	      b) run server
	      c) run client
	      d) test echo function
	         Command: 'this a SMOKE test'
	         and see the same string get returned.

3. Stress test
	   1) Test goal: Apache Bench to test the maximum connections server can handle
	   2) Test procedures:
	      a) compile program by make 
	      b) use ab -n 100 -c 10 http://127.0.0.1:8080/ 
	      c) see test results and view lisod.log.


Vulnerabilities:
1. Server cannot handle when there are too many connections (more than 1020).
2. Server can only accept certain types of requests 
3. Can only accept limited number of filetype for HEAD request
4. Can only support limited HTTP version
